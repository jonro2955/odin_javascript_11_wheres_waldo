# Where's Waldo?

[Live Site](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_javascript_11_wheres_waldo/)

This project demonstrate my skills in using ReactJS and Firebase to develop interactive webapps with backend functionalities. The app implements an online version of "Where's Waldo", an activity where users try to find several hidden elements inside of a picture as fast as possible. Each attempt is timed, and upon completion of a level, the user may enter their name into a cloud based leaderboard.
