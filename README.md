# Where's Waldo?

[Live Site](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_javascript_11_wheres_waldo/)

This project demonstrates my skills in using ReactJS and Firebase to develop interactive webapps with backend functionalities. The app implements an interactive version of the "Where's Waldo" game, an activity where users try to find several visual elements obscured inside of a picture containing many different visual objects. In this particular case, each attempt to fined all the required elements is timed, and upon completion, the user may enter their name into a cloud based leaderboard. 

Key lessons from this exercise are: using interactive CSS elements to create visual effects such as mouse click animations,using back end SDKs such as Firebase to implement back ends, and organizing ReactJS project files and using NPM.
