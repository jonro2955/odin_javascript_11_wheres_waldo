# Where's Waldo? 
## [Live Site](https://jonro2955.github.io/odin_javascript_11_wheres_waldo/)

This app implements an interactive version of the "Where's Waldo" game, an activity where players try to find several visual elements obscured inside of a picture containing many different visual objects. In this version, the goal is to find all assigned items as fast as possible under a timer. Upon completion, the user may enter their name and time into a cloud based leaderboard. 

This project demonstrates my skills in using ReactJS and Firebase to develop interactive webapps with backend functionalities. Key lessons learned from this exercise are: using interactive CSS elements to create visual effects such as mouse click animations,using back end SDKs such as Firebase to implement back ends, and organizing ReactJS project files and using NPM.
