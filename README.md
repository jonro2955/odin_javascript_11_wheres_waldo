# Where's Waldo?

This project demonstrate my skills in using ReactJS and Firebase to develop interactive webpages. The app is a photo tagging game that implements a digital version of "Where's Waldo", an activity where users try to find hidden elements inside a picture. The goal is to find the assigned items as fast as possible under a timer. Upon completion, users may enter their name to register their time into a cloud database.
